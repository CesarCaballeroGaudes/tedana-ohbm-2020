Welcome to poster 1083 “tedana multi-echo software and communal resources.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,000
I’m Dan Handwerker and I’m representing the growing tedana community. Tedana has two main parts. 

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:17,000
First, it’s an open source software that is designed to process and denoise multi-echo fMRI data. 

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,000
Second, it’s a community and resources for people interested in multi-echo fMRI whether or not they use tedana.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,000
The software is based on a multi-echo ICA approach that was initially developed by Prantik Kundu. 

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,000
We have attempted to make that method more modular and understandable so members of our community, perhaps including you, 

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,500
can better validate existing methods and develop better multi-echo fMRI tools. 

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:47,000
A key addition in the past year has been an interactive reports page where users can examine each component that was accepted or rejected to better understand why. 

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,000
The poster includes a static version of this report and here I am going to demonstrate the dynamic version

10
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,000
What you see up here is a pie chart of variance explained of each ICA component. 

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,000
For each of these components you can see as I hover over it, it tells us some information about the component

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:10,000
We can see the same data as a scatter plot of kappa, which is a rough T2* weighting

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:18,000
versus rho, which is a rough S0 measure. Higher kappa and lower rho is typically considered signal that we want to keep.

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,000
and these are again sorted by rho values and kappa values. 

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,000
What's dynamic about this report is that not only do you see this, I can click on one of these and you can see

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,000
this is a high variance rejected component. It's the linear drift of our signal.

17
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,000
This is the time series, the spatial map, and the frequency. So we can click on other rejected components

18
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,000
to get a sense of what's being rejected, and also click on accepted components to see what's being accepted

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,000
for example this is our highest kappa accepted component, and this looks like the response

20
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,000
from a task design with high visual cortex activity, and this is the frequency of that signal

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:02:00,000
so this is a very nice improvement because, when we get these results sometimes it's a little bit opaque of what's happening

22
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,000
so this is one more way of understanding what's happening, and better understand both

23
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,000
your own data, and, if you're interested, better try to figure out what 

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,000
is or isn't working to both help yourself and us improve the method.

25
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:18,000
We do recognize that not everyone who is working with multi-echo fMRI can or wants to use tedana as a software. 

26
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:24,000
In response to discussions at the last OHBM, we’ve greatly expanded the documentation on the tedana website

27
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,000
to include resources that may benefit the wider community.

28
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,000
In our documenation, you can see that we have the tedana pipeline, so we have all the stuff that's software specific

29
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,000
We have the pipeline. We have the API, which goes through every function.

30
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,000
But we've also added a lot of text on things like "What is multi-echo fMRI"

31
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,000
basic physics of it with links to things where you can read more

32
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,000
"Why would you want to use multi-echo", Considerations for when you're going to use it.

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,000
that might influence your decision. We've added resources of the different vendors

34
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:03,000
that includes sequences you can get for each vendor. How to think about what parameters to use.

35
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,000
"what parameters have been used in publications"

36
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:13,000
and finally, we have this section on good starting point articles, and videos, and lessons

37
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,000
if you want to learn more about multi-echo fMRI. Other people's software that uses multi-echo fMRI

38
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,000
and open data sets we're starting to collect and 

39
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,000
and we've been trying to maintain a list of all publications that use multi-echo fMRI

40
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,000
If you use multi-echo fMRI, whether or not you use tedana software, we welcome contributions. 

41
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,000
Particularly, if you have published a study with multi-echo fMRI, make sure we have it on our list of all multi-echo fMRI publications. 

42
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you for taking the time to visit our poster and we welcome questions and contributions.
